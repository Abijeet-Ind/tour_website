 why 
 super(message)  ==== because this only accepts the buildin parameters (in simple : calling errors).
 startsWith ==== shows first word value which is assigned to it
 isOperational === all of the errors get this property set to true so we can test this property and only send error message back
                    to the client for operational errors that we created using this class.
 stackTract == err.stack === show where the error happens     
 Error.captureStackTrace  === when a new object is created and a constructor function is called then the function call is not ganna appear
                    in the stackTrace and not gonna pollute it.
